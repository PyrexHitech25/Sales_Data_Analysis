# Sales_Data_Analysis

Hello, this is my sales repository, i will perform Datacleaning and Analysing to achieve a report

I will use Python to clean and transform the dataset and Power BI to visualize a report.

The dataset comes from ChatGPT, i just prompted to create me a dataset with a lot of messy data, the topic was Sales Data.

The dataset has the following columns and descriptions:

1. order_id = the order identification number

2. order_date = the purchase date

3. product = the product which got puchased

4. quantity = how many products got purchased

5. unit_price = the price of the individual product

6. totol_price = the complete price the customer purchased

7. region = the region the sale was purchased, in this case the categorys are continents

8. sales_person = the employee who made the sale with the customer

9. discount = the amount of discount the customer recived in procent of his total_price

10. notes = individual notes about the kind of payment the employee noted
